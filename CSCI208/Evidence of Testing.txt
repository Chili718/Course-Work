CSCI 208

Evidence of Testing:
Throughout testing of the entire program only two users were allowed as input.
When the program was finsihed a full twelve users were input and tested through selecting records.
The ID number cannot be longer than an integers length or it creates a huge error
For the names if you accidentally entered the first and last name is skipped the rest of the program and needed to be terminated
Tested code that did not allow for an invalid RR number to be entered i.e. -1
The file user.dat is created and used to store and read the users inputed data
